          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p align="center">
            Mr. Turtle is inspired by the thousands of sea turtles and marine
            aquatic life that suffer as a result of ocean pollution. Humans have
            increased the amount of trash disposed of each year with an average
            of 3.5 million tons per day. This number is increasing rapidly as
            each year passes. To highlight the importance of recycling and
            reducing waste, Mr. Turtle is a game, suitable for all ages, to see
            the harmful effects of plastic in the ocean.
          </p>

          <p align="center">
            The Earth is a magnificent creation and provides us with many
            resources. It is our duty to maintain and preserve it for future
            generations. It is not only humans that live on Earth but also
            billions of other living things that all depend on the environment.
            Therefore, we should emphasize the importance of environmentally
            friendly products and reducing plastic usage.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p align="center">
            Education and entertainment is the best way for people to learn
            something so we hope that Mr. Turtle will teach everyone about water
            pollution along with environmental pollution as a whole. If turtles
            can help, then so can you.
          </p>
